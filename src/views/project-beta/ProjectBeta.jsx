                      with a service idea and built a website to sell it.

                        Every day, more people adventure into the digital world.
                        Something that has though us these past few years is the
                        importance of the internet and the satisfaction of
                        working from home.Currently, we live a fast life. Where
                        almost everything can be reached or bought with just the
                        touch of a thumb.

                      <p className="beta-text">
                        Smaller companies or people that want to start their own
                        businesses almost don't stand a chance next to the
                        competition. They have years of experience, the best
                        teams and most importantly,the funds.
                      </p>
                      <p className="beta-text">
                        First hand, I have seen many people and smaller
                        businesses experience the overwhelms of today's industry
                        and how hard it is to stand out to the public. How many
                        of us have the funds to hire a decent team that could
                        help us to open an online shop? Many of us wouldn't be
                        able. Causing us to go for the cheapest option, which
                        most of the time leads to an unhappy end.
                      </p>
                      <p className="beta-text">
                        Keeping all that in mind, I came up with the idea of
                        Resoluta (that comes from the Latin word resolutus). An
                        International platform with professional teams that
                        would be available to the public 24hr. Ready to solve
                        any issue, start up any idea/dream, or step in when help
                        is required. Without excluding any person and all for
                        reachable prices.

                        student. Due to the lack of time available, it was
                        definitely challenging. I had to accept the
                        circumstances and did my best to make the right

                        First hand, I may have not experienced how difficult it
                        is to start your own online business. However, I do
                        understand the hard work and effort that goes behind the
                        scenes. From the first idea to the very end, it can be a
                        long process that may become overwhelming without the
                        resources and knowledge.

                        Therefore, I conducted some research exercises. In one
                        of does exercises, I decided to go around asking people
                        whom I knew questions like" if they have wanted to open
                        their own online shop, if they desired to own an online

                        achieve it". This semi-interview and research were done
                        for my own curiosity and most importantly to have a
                        better understanding of the topic.

                          Once I started to get a better understanding of the

                          User personas, user flows and wireframes were created
                          to help solve the problem. Studying the competition

                      Coming from a Graphic design and Illustration background,
                      I'm aware of how important feedback is and how sometimes
                      we need to focus on the client's needs and likes. Other
                      than our personal beliefs or taste. Nonetheless, this
                      project was eye-opening for me personally. I never truly
                      understood or knew how much thought and work was done
                      before starting the design process. The design process was
                      the smallest percentage of the work required.
                    </p>
                    <p className="beta-text">
                      There were up and downs, but I'm truly happy and proud of
                      the outcome.
