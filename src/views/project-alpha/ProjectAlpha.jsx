                        Coming from a design background, naturally, the design
                        aspect was the least challenging. However, designing a
                        responsive website was completely out of my comfort zone
                        and something that I have never done beforehand.

                        Naturally, my main focus and concern at the begging was
                        the design. Once, I started to research and compare
                        other UI&UX designer's portfolios. I was able to start
                        testing the design ideas. I went through a couple of
                        rounds of testing different design approaches.

                        After defining my personal challenges, testing different
                        designs and creating a user flow. I started working with
                        the user interface.

                      <p className="alpha-text">
                        My main focus with this design was to showcase my
                        personality throughout the screen. From the colour,
                        space between sections, fonts and every small detail was
                        well thought chosen. I would describe myself as a
                        minimalistic, kind-hearted, hard-working/passionate
                        person. Does were the keywords that I used as
                        inspiration throughout my design process.

                      <p className="alpha-text">
                        I achieve that by creating a clean/minimalistic layout
                        throughout the website. I added a light version of my
                        favourite colour "lilac/purple" to the design. Just add
                        the right amount of colour to catch the user's attention
                        through the one-page website. Balancing all perfectly
                        together with the black & white pictures.

                      <p className="alpha-text">
                        The only reason why I choose black and white pictures
                        was because of my personal taste. It was the only thing
                        that I did for my own personal taste.

                        One of the requirements of this project was to show our
                        skills. My approach to showcase my personal details and
                        soft skills was creating different organize accordions
                        for each individual skill (they are seen in the final
                        design).

                      <p className="alpha-text">
                        Personally, I felt that I need to add a personal
                        statement as to why I decided to study design. Attention
                        to detail has always been important to me, and that is
                        the reason I decided to add a personal touch. Hoping to
                        build a potential bond with the user.
